# Bartender

This is the current janky code for the bartender bot.

It uses a Python script (that does not run on boot) to host a website on port 5000. 
The website is run using Flask and uses other Python scrips and JSON files to store relevent information such as pump allocations, possible drinks etc.

It's a massive mess...
